      Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made
      from dairy milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative,
      and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can
      also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Colorings are
      sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of
      water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from
      forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below
      2 째C or 35 째F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
